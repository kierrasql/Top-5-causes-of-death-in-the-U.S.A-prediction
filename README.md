# Top-5-causes-of-death-in-the-U.S.A-prediction
The top five causes of death to American citizens are trending uphill and it is forecasted that one of these top factors will cause over 1.5 million deaths by the year 2028. The main question that will be answered today is “What has been the top five factors of death to Americans over the past 20 years?” My hypothesis is that deaths will increase by year since there will be more people in the states by that time. However according to my analysis it surprisingly doesn’t seem as though deaths will be growing by too much for the next 10 years. Why? I believe medicines and technology have improved a lot over the years and that’s predictably why we're able to maintain a certain  number of deaths per year. The results were that the main causes of death were malignant neoplasm, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, unintentional injury and chronic lower respiratory disease. Heart disease was found to be the top killer of Americans and it has been since 1998. It is also forecasted that by the year 2028 heart disease will slowly rise to over 1.5 million deaths compared to 2018 when it was 1.3 million deaths. In my video analysis, I discovered the growth rate of death over the years, the age most people die from the top five, forecasted predictions and more interesting facts. Thanks for reading and watching!
